# 📍 Miami Beach Venues | Interactive Map Visualization in Tableau

Welcome to the **Miami Beach Venues Dashboard**, a visually immersive Tableau project that showcases popular venues across the Miami Beach area. This project features a **custom-designed dataset**, enriched with detailed location data, and brought to life using **Mapbox custom styles** and **interactive visual storytelling** in Tableau.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is a creative data visualization built using **Tableau Desktop Public Edition**, where I:

- Created a **custom dataset** of venues located in Miami Beach.
- Mapped each venue using a **Mapbox custom map style**.
- Implemented tooltips showing:
  - Venue **name**
  - **Street address**
  - **Venue image** using a **custom shape** (since Tableau doesn't support direct image rendering in tooltips).
- Designed a dual layout compatible with both **desktop** and **mobile views**.

## 💡 Project Inspiration

This project was inspired by the challenge of making **geographic data visual and interactive** in Tableau. Since image tooltips are not supported, I experimented with **shape overlays** to provide a similar experience. The result is an engaging map-based interface that blends visuals with data storytelling.
